# comments helper

from [http://jekyllbootstrap.com/api/theme-api.html#jekyll_bootstrap_helpers](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/api/theme-api.html#jekyll_bootstrap_helpers)

like JB/analytics and JB/comments, I need helpers on weibo and douban


# auto list helper

list titles of markdown files of the same directory 

so i can use index.html in every directory as a self-generated index page
