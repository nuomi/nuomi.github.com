##归属感

The reason why Ben was so involved in LugRadio, why Neil ran the Linux User Group meeting, and why thousands of other community members around the world get together, comes down to one simple word: belonging.

...

These interactions, and the feeling of belonging that they produce, are generated from a distinctive kind of economy: a social economy.

##社区的实质

So let’s have a quick recap:

- A sense of belonging is what keeps people in communities. This belonging is the goal of community building. The hallmark of a strong community is when its members feel that they belong.

- Belonging is the measure of a strong social economy. This economy’s currency is not the money that you find in your wallet or down the back of your couch, but is social capital.

- For an economy and community to be successful, the participants need to believe in it. If no one believes in the community that brings them together, it fails.

- Like any other economy, a social economy is a collection of processes that describe how something works and is shared among those who participate.

- These processes, and the generation of social capital, which in turn generates belonging, need to be effectively communicated.

So far, we have talked extensively about our goals (belonging), the medium of exchange (social capital), and what is at the heart of an economy (processes). We now need to focus on the final component that binds each of these concepts together: communication.
