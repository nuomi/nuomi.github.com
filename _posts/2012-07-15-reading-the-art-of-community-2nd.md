##信任 Trust

community is fundamentally a social economy, and its participants build up social capital via their contributions. With social capital being, by its very nature, a product of social interaction, trust is critical. 

You want everyone in that community to think of you as an accessible, approachable, sensitive person, and trust is required for any of these roles.

...some people are going to frustrate you ...

##Avoid Ego, or Others Will Avoid You

Unfortunately, I have seen ego claim too many victims. I have seen community leaders who have commanded incredible respect and adoration from their legions of fans, but have washed it away when they assume a sense of entitlement. In any community, entitlement is an enemy: it values the person over the contribution, creating unrealistic expectations about how people should be treated. People with this sense of entitlement typically identify the wider contributions of the community, but see their fame as a red carpet that others don’t have access to. You can avoid the wrath of ego by always remembering that in your role as a community
leader you are responsible to the team, not for the team.

##Theory Versus Action: Action Wins

What makes a great community leader is experience: trying new ideas and concepts and learning from the successes and mistakes.

##Becoming Yourself

Your “secret sauce” is you. Your personality is the greatest asset that you have. Earlier we talked about how trust is the most critical component in being a great community leader. If you try to become someone who you are not, you will sacrifice that most important of traits. Be yourself. Identify your own traits, celebrate the good, and learn to improve the bad, but always be yourself; it will put you in good stead.

My father-in-law’s statement—“Live your life honestly—if you don’t, you always have to remember to not be yourself”—actually goes much deeper. Not only should we aspire to lead a good and principled life, but if we live it in a way that is honest to who we really are, we never need to worry about maintaining the illusion.
